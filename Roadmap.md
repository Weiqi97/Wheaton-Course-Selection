# Roadmap
###### (Stuff below are listed by priority [High to Low])
- :exclamation: **Bugfix**
  - Data Table related :sleepy: (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)
    - [ ] Wrap special information when it is too long.
    - [x] Fix length of all columns, so the table does not change when content changes.
  - Front-end appearance :dizzy:
    - [x] Background shifts when sweet alert pops up. (Because sweet alert hides the scroll bar - Switched to jQuery Confirm.)
  - Front-end code :muscle:
    - [x] Move javascript code to separate file.
    - [ ] Clean up CSS and document. 
- :star2: **Features**
  - Calendar related :innocent:
    - [x] Add a remove button when class is added to the calendar. (DONE!)
    - [ ] Allow users to add their own event.
    - [ ] Save as PDF.
    - [ ] Check overlap time. (We need to find a proper solution for this, there are multiple ways.) (IMPORTANT)
  - Relatively easy features :fireworks:
    - [ ] A better looking contact us. (In general redesign footer.)
    - [ ] Give users an option to choose two modes. (One with calendar, one without.)
- :alien: **Future work**
  - A mobile friendly version. (Contains only search functionality. Thanks to bootstrap, this should be quite trivial.)
  - If a class has related lab session, add the lab session as well when user choose to add the class to calendar.
  - Design. (It always gets better. Doesn't it :wink:)
