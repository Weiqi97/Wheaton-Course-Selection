  - Finish implementing the "add to calendar functionality".
  - Allow users to add their own event.
  - Test with different browsers and fix design issue.
- Functionalities for future work.
  - Give users an option to choose two modes. (One with calendar, one without.)

  - Design. (It always gets better.)
